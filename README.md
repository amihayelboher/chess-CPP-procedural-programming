# chess-CPP-procedural-programming

The .cpp file contains an implementation of chess according to the formal rules of current most competitions.

Each player should insert column and line of source and destination.
The column should be a lowercase English character, and the number is obviously a digit in the range of 1 through 8, inclusively.
(Spaces are ignored.)

The only things left to be implemented are the function for checkmate and draw checking.
For both, there are detailed comments for what should be done.
Anything else was tested and work correctly.
